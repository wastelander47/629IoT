I don't know what's the correct format for a weekly report, but here it is.

I followed the steps on lesson1 and successfully started my raspberry Pi.

Then I enabled my Google account's 2-step verification, generated a Google App 16-letter password and put it into the code.


And I ran the code to send an email to my subaccount. My subaccount received the mail successfully.

At last I tried to make a connection by VNC Viewer.

That's the end of my second weekly report.
