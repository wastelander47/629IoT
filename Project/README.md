## Room Temperature and Humidity Monitor

In this project I implemented a room temprature and humidity monitor via Raspberry Pi 4. The DHT11 sensor was used to monitor the room's temprature and humidity and the flask was used to upload the result to the website. The project was implemented by python3.


### DHT11 
The DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor is a nice little sensor that provides digital temperature and humidity readings. Itâ€™s really easy to set up, and only requires one wire for the data signal. These sensors are popular for use in remote weather stations, soil monitors, and home automation systems.
